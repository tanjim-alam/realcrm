# ðŸ“§ Email Notifications Setup Guide

## Quick Setup

To enable email notifications in your Real Estate CRM, you need to configure SMTP settings.

### 1. Create Environment File

Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

```env
# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key

# Email Configuration (Required for notifications)
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Real Estate CRM

# Default notification email
DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com

# Server
PORT=8080
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 2. Gmail Setup (Recommended)

#### Step 1: Enable 2-Factor Authentication
1. Go to your Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security
3. Enable 2-Step Verification

#### Step 2: Generate App Password
1. Go to Google Account settings
2. Navigate to Security â†’ 2-Step Verification
3. Scroll down to "App passwords"
4. Generate a new app password for "Mail"
5. Use this password as `SMTP_PASS` (not your regular password)

#### Step 3: Update Environment Variables
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-gmail@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-16-character-app-password
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Your Company Name
```

### 3. Other Email Providers

#### Outlook/Hotmail
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp-mail.outlook.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@outlook.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
```

#### Yahoo
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.mail.yahoo.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@yahoo.com
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password
```

#### Custom SMTP Server
```env
SMTP_HOST=your-smtp-server.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-email@yourdomain.com
SMTP_PASS=your-password
```

### 4. Test Email Configuration

1. Start your server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the Notifications page in your CRM
3. Enter your email address
4. Click "Send Test Email"
5. Check your inbox for the test email

### 5. Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues:

**"Email service not configured"**
- Check that all SMTP environment variables are set
- Restart the server after adding environment variables

**"Authentication failed"**
- For Gmail: Use App Password, not regular password
- Check that 2FA is enabled
- Verify email and password are correct

**"Connection timeout"**
- Check SMTP_HOST and SMTP_PORT
- Ensure firewall allows outbound connections on port 587
- Try port 465 with `secure: true` for some providers

**"Invalid credentials"**
- Double-check SMTP_USER and SMTP_PASS
- For Gmail: Make sure you're using App Password
- Test credentials with email client first

### 6. Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` file to version control
- Use App Passwords instead of regular passwords
- Consider using environment-specific configuration
- Regularly rotate your App Passwords

### 7. Production Setup

For production, set these environment variables in your hosting platform:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your-production-email@gmail.com
SMTP_PASS=your-production-app-password
SMTP_FROM_NAME=Your Company Name
DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL=admin@yourcompany.com
```

## Testing

After configuration, you should see:
